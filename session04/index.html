        <h2>What Are Mushrooms?</h2>
        <p id="intro">
            A <span class="highlight">mushroom</span> is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground, on soil, or on its food source. Mushrooms are a rich source of nutrients and have been used in food, medicine, and cultural practices worldwide.
        </p>

        <h3>General Description</h3>
        <p id="highlight">
           The standard for the name "mushroom" is the cultivated white button mushroom, <span class="emphasis">Agaricus bisporus</span>; hence, the word "mushroom" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap. "Mushroom" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems; therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. The gills produce microscopic spores which help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.
        </p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Forms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names, such as "bolete", "truffle", "puffball", "stinkhorn", and "morel", and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called "agarics" in reference to their similarity to Agaricus or their order Agaricales.
