                        <h2>About</h2>
                        <p><em>Cortinarius violaceus, commonly known as the violet webcap or violet cort, is a fungus in
                                the webcap genus, Cortinarius, for which it serves as the type species. It was first
                                described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 and has undergone several name changes. It is readily
                                distinguished from other species in the genus by its dark colouration and distinct
                                cystidia. There are some populations that seem to prefer deciduous trees and others that
                                prefer pines, but no genetic divergence between the two has been found. When identified
                                as taxonomically separate from the deciduous-preferring populations, the pine-preferring
                                populations have been referred to either as a separate species, C. hercynicus, or as a
                                subspecies, C. violaceus ssp. hercynicus. Other populations once identified as C.
                                violaceus or close to that species have now been described as new and separate species,
                                such as C. palatinus, C. neotropicus, C. altissimus, C. kioloensis and C.
                                hallowellensis.</p>

                        <h2>Habitat and Identification</h2>
                        <p>Cortinarius violaceus is found across North America, Europe and Asia.[14] Although
                            widespread, it is not common anywhere in Europe,and it is listed as endangered in the
                            British Isles. Cortinarius violaceus is a rare component of subarctic areas of western
                            Greenland.[24] It has not been recorded from Iceland.</p>
                        <p>In Europe, it grows in deciduous woodland during autumn, especially among oak, birch and
                            beech, but is also found on occasion with conifers. It is also occasionally known from
                            treeless heathland, where it is associated with bracken. The species fayours acidic soil.
                            Cortinarius violaceus forms mycorrhizal associations with several species of tree. In this
                            symbiotic relationship, the fungus gains carbon from the plant and supplies it with
                            beneficial minerals. In Nordic countries, its hosts include white birch (Betula pubescens),
                            silver birch (B. pendula), European aspen (Populus tremula) and rarely European beech (Eagus
                            sylvatica). No records of association with oak (Quercus) are known from this region.
                            Brandrud reported that what he described as spp. hercynicus grew with Picea abies, generally
                            in more alkaline soils and along with mosses of the genera Hylocomium and Pleurozium, and,
                            in moister areas, big shaggy-moss (Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus), as well as the
                            buttercup-family shrub Hepatica nobilis. The species grows with Retula pubessens in
                            Greenland, and is also associated with hazelnut (Corylus avellang) in Central and Southern
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>In North America, C. violaceus favours conifers, and, though rare over much of the continent,
                            is relatively common in certain areas, including Mount Rainier National Park and Olympic
                            National Park. It is more common in old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest, though has
                            sprung up in regrowth areas populated with fir, pine, aspen and alder in the Great Lakes
                            region. Fruit bodies occur singly or in small groups, often near rotting wood, and can grow
                            in fairy rings. Closely related species that look like C. violaceus can be found in Central
                            and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia.</p>

                <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
                <p>The violet pigment in <em>C. violaceus</em> fades quickly when exposed to sunlight or cooking.
                    Despite its rarity, it plays a key role in forest ecosystems.</p>
